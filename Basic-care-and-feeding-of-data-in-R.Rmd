learn what is **data.frame** 

Firstly, loading a data.frame:
```{r}
library(gapminder)
```
most functions for inference, modelling, and graphing are happy to be passed a data.frame via a `data = `
Get an overview of this with `str()`,then it’s nicer to look at the first bit or the last bit or a random snippet.

```{r}
str(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
tail(gapminder)
gapminder[sample(nrow(gapminder), 10), ]
names(gapminder)
ncol(gapminder)
length(gapminder)
head(rownames(gapminder))
dim(gapminder)
nrow(gapminder)
rownames(gapminder)
colnames(gapminder)
summary(gapminder)
plot(lifeExp ~ year, gapminder)
plot(lifeExp ~ gdpPercap, gapminder)
plot(lifeExp ~ log(gdpPercap), gapminder)
```
To specify a single variable from a data.frame, use the dollar sign `$`
```{r}
head(gapminder$lifeExp)
summary(gapminder$lifeExp)
hist(gapminder$lifeExp)
summary(gapminder$year)
table(gapminder$year)
class(gapminder$continent)
summary(gapminder$continent)
levels(gapminder$continent)
nlevels(gapminder$continent)
table(gapminder$continent)
barplot(table(gapminder$continent))

```
`subset()` is a nice way to isolate bits of data.frames (and other things)
```{r}
subset(gapminder, subset = country == "Uruguay")
#equals to:
gapminder[1621:1632, ]

```
Yes, these both return the same result. But the second command is horrible for these reasons:

1, It contains *Magic Numbers*. The reason for keeping rows 1621 to 1632 will be non-obvious to someone else and that includes you in a couple of weeks.
2, It is fragile. If the rows of gapminder are reordered or if some observations are eliminated, these rows may no longer correspond to the Uruguay data.

The subset() function can also be used to select certain variables via the select argument. 
```{r}
subset(gapminder, subset = country == "Mexico", select = c(country, year, lifeExp))


```

```{r}
(minYear <- min(gapminder$year))
myFit <- lm(lifeExp ~ I(year - minYear), gapminder, subset = country == "Colombia")
summary(myFit)

```
Example: How would you compute the correlation of life expectancy and GDP per capita for the country of Colombia? The cor() function sadly does not offer the usual data = and subset = arguments. Here’s a nice way to combine with() and subset() to accomplish without unnecessary object creation and with fairly readable code.
```{r}
with(subset(gapminder, subset = country == "Colombia"), cor(lifeExp, gdpPercap))

```

```{r}


```

```{r}


```

Two important practices

give variables short informative names (lifeExp versus “X5”)
refer to variables by name, not by column number
This will produce code that is self-documenting and more robust. 

**Never ever use attach(). It is evil. **
